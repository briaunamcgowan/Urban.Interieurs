# urban.interieurs
Project for TCP - Build a website

Our group created a website for Urban Interi√©urs, an interior design company based out of Atlanta, GA. The concept is high end luxury design that caters towards conodminiums and lofts. We created 5 pages (Home, About, Gallery, Services, Reviews) to tell the story of who we are and what we do.

We used the tools we have learned thus far in our Technology Career Program with TechBridge.


Our group was assigned the task to create a website with the following criteria:
a. 1 heading and 5 paragraphs - HTML elements
b. 1 list - HTML elements
c. 1 grid - Bootstrap
d. Link to external stylesheet and script file
e. 5 images 
f. 2 Javascript/jQuery feautures
README document
