    <p>Urban Interieurs did a fantastic job with my condo. Blinds where recommended, which looked fantastic! There was a very small manufacturing defect in one of the shades and it was replaced quickly with no hassle. As an homeowner, they are very hands on, knowledgeable and accessible.There prices were also better than the competitors. I would highly recommend their services.</p>

    <p>I would like to highly recommend Crystal Augustus to anyone looking for a designer who they can trust to produce a beautiful result in their home. I first saw Crystal's work at a friends home and was extremely impresed. I wanted to transform my sitting room and bring it up to date, but also have a room that would stand the test of time and have a touch of class and luxury. Crystal achieved this for me. She went above and beyond, advising on colours, textures and acessories. I am delighted wuth the result.</p>

    <p>Having never worked with an Interior Designer previously, I was apprehensive contacting Urban Interieurs, concerned that we would end up with rooms that we did not feel comfortable in. However, within a few minutes of speaking with Jeronica Collins, all such concerns disappeared. Jeronica made it clear that she worked with her clients to ensure that the end result reflected their lifestyle and needs. At our first consultation, Jeronica took time with us to understand our requirements, e.g. curtains, blinds, upholstery,colours etc. that we liked. The Scheme she put together for us created a calming oasis, which was exactly what we wanted to achieve, but would never have been able to do so ourselves. Jeronica was always available to consult with during the implementation phase of the design and answer any questions we had. Thanks to Jeronica and her excellent team. We now have rooms which are a pleasure to be in. I can not recommend the services of Urban Interieurs and Jeronica highly enough to anybody thinking about re-decorating their home.</p>

    <p>Without a doubt the best value for money during our office renovation was Urban Interieurs Design.  Every step in the project from design to final walkthrough was stress-free and enjoyable thanks to the competence of Crystal and her team.  Their impeccable taste and knowledge of all things design was reassuring.  When complications arose, Crystal dealt with them promptly and professionally.  The end result is a beautiful, functional home that we receive compliments on almost daily.  Best of all, there are no lingering issues or deficiencies.  We feel lucky to have had their help.</p>

             <p>We are so grateful to have chosen Urban Interieurs for our recent project designing Canton Townhomes. We had the pleasure of working closely with the there team. They were professional, supportive, and understood every part of what we wanted to capture in great detail. They captured not only the design of the space that we wanted to create, but also how we wanted clients to feel – welcomed and cared for from the moment they walked through our door to the moment they leave.
            We have had amazing feedback on the beauty of our space down to each one of the details. Each part of our design was creative and solution focused. Briauna took great care in ensuring we understood the process of the design to completion. Our meetings and time spent with them were effective and drove us forward. Briauna has amazing communication skills, are always organized and listened well.
            We loved working with Briauna's team and would highly recommend them for their leadership and amazing customer experience. They were not only easy to work with, but were also willing to take the time to respond to our questions and concerns.</p>

           <p>It isn’t often that you are able to find a true partner on a project. Working with Jeronica has always been such an enjoyable experience. Jeronica made significant effort to understand the objectives of the space, and she was always available to solve challenges as they arose. Not only that, the design of the Perch space constantly impresses. I continue to lean on Jeronica for design decisions, and hope to have an opportunity to work with her again in the future.</p>
